# Fernando Flores Hernandez' Personal Website

My personal website to build a personal brand
Built using AngularCLI, and Angular4

## Development

Run `ng serve` to run locally, changes are updated automatically when saved.<br>
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
<br>

To deploy to `www.fernflores.me` run the command `npm run deploy` <br>
This will push the compiled and minimized source code to the gh-pages branch as well as push to the website
